Technology Safety educational materials for domestic violence victim advocates

These materials have been created as a courtesy to domestic violence victim advocates everywhere. Hopefully, the advocates will learn how to help victims with technology-enabled coercive control. Feel free to share these materials with anybody that would benefit.
