Technology Safety educational materials for domestic violence victim advocates

These materials have been created as a courtesy to domestic violence victim advocates everywhere. Hopefully, the advocates will learn how to help victims with technology-enabled coercive control. Feel free to share these materials with anybody that would benefit.

***NEW :: 05-23-2020 ::Currently, we are in the middle of producing instructional mini videos to help teach how to do the things we mentioned in the presentation Abuse Using Technology. 
>>> If anybody is willing to help produce these videos, please send an email to vicilanaya@yahoo.com.
